# Software Engineering Resource

## Interesting Article
[Microsoft Developer Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/)

## Why I Found It Interesting
The Microsoft Developer Blog talks about best practices in software development, frameworks, DevOps, and cloud engineering.
I think it’s interesting because it doesn’t just show new tools and technologies, but also gives examples of how big engineering teams use software engineering principles in real projects.

As a student, I find this helpful because it gives me a better idea of how professional developers deal with problems like scalability, reliability, and teamwork in real software projects.
